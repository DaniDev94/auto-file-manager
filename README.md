# download-factorialhr-files
This repository arises out of necessity and serves to download all the files from the factorialhr website. This is because the website lacks a button/functionality to download them all at once, requiring manual download of each file one by one.

## Installation

```bash
npm install
```

## Instructions

1. Visit the URL "https://api.factorialhr.com/documents" (after logging into factorial).

2. Copy the entire array and paste it into the "index.js" file under the constant "USERJSON".

3. Open a terminal and execute the following command:

```bash
npm run download
```

4. And enjoy your files, young dev Jedi!!!
